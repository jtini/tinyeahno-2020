            text: "For years, Spruce had evolved without any real design direction. We had created a small and simple library of components early on, but it hadn't changed in several years. As a result, component availability became the driver of experience design. This created an experience that felt wonky and awkward. On top of that, there was internal confusion on the team due to lack of a shared language around the product."

            kind: 'text',
            text: "My goal with Heartwood was to create a shared design language to help our team improve Spruce. I decided early on that this would be more than a component library. We needed a tool, or a set of tools, that would scale with the product."

# Defining our Design Principles
Before getting into visual styles or components, we defined our design principles. These would serve as stimulus for all future design decisions.
