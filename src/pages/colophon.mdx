# Colophon

Jeremy Tinianow designed and developed this site. “Tin Yeah No” is how you pronounce his last name.

This site was designed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's hosted on [Github](https://github.com/).

The big beautiful serif display face is called [Moret](https://thenorthernblock.co.uk/font/moret) and was designed by [Jamie Chang](https://thenorthernblock.co.uk/blog/meet-the-team-jamie-chang). Most of the type is set in [National 2](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national-2/) from [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz/). The little monospaced bits use [ETC Trispace](https://fontsarena.com/etc-trispace-by-etc/) from [Etcetera Type Company](https://www.etc.supply/).
