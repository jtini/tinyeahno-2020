## A Smiling Logo
The old logo always felt a bit off, for reasons the team found hard to vocalize. Looking at it through the lens of Heartwood's Humanity principle made it clear. The logo was frowning. The solution was to make it smile.

## Bridging the Gap
Illustrations bridge the gap between visual identity and product. We focused on interjecting playful illustrations at moments when a user experiences success

## Four Words
I worked with the Engineering team to create a set of lettering pieces to reflect their values. They had chosen four words and chose one to focus on every week.
