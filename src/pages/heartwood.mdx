As a result, component availability became the driver of experience design. This created an experience that felt wonky and awkward. On top of that, there was internal confusion on the team due to lack of a shared language around the product."

            text: "My goal with Heartwood was to create a shared design language to help our team improve Spruce. I decided early on that this would be more than a component library. We needed a tool, or a set of tools, that would scale with the product."

## Defining our Design Principles
Before getting into visual styles or components, we defined our design principles. These would serve as stimulus for all future design decisions.

![Heartwood design principles graphic](/heartwood/Heartwood-Design-Principles@2x.png "Heartwood’s core design principles.")

Working with the rest of the team, we explored the company's core values as a jumping off point. The result of this exploration was four key principles:

1. **Humanity:** Spruce exists to enhance human-to-human interaction.
2. **Physicality:** We are creating the digital platform for physical retail.
3. **Augmentation:** Technology is good at things that humans aren’t, and vice versa.
4. **Flexibility:** Change is the only constant.

## System Architecture
The next step was to determine Heartwood's system architecture. The last thing we wanted was to create a pretty design system that never gets implemented. We worked with the engineering team to figure out how we could get Heartwood into place and keep it up to date.
