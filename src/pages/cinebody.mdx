![Updates to the component library aimed at improving affordance and accommodating new features.](/cinebody/Cinebody-Style@2x.png)

The Cinebody team and Barbershop’s leadership briefed me on high-level project goals and feature requirements. My objective was to translate the overall goals and design direction into a cohesive set of updates to the platform to be implemented by our development team in accordance with our project timeline. I aimed to use as much as possible of the existing UI elements, while adding any necessary new components to achieve the project goals. At the end of the design phase, I began contributing to the production codebase, while making necessary adjustments to the designs in order to address any challenges we came across.
