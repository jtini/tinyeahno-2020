## A Smiling Logo
The old logo always felt a bit off, for reasons the team found hard to vocalize. Looking at it through the lens of Heartwood's Humanity principle made it clear. The logo was frowning. The solution was to make it smile.

## A More Expansive Color Palette
The old color palette was a bit spare when it came to expressiveness. We devised an approach that would focus on how we create contrast, rather than on specific colors. This enabled our creative team to try lots of ideas and push the envelope. At the same time, we had enough parameters to avoid visual chaos.

## Bridging the Gap
Illustrations bridge the gap between visual identity and product. We focused on interjecting playful illustrations at moments when a user experiences success

## Four Words
I worked with the Engineering team to create a set of lettering pieces to reflect their values. They had chosen four words and chose one to focus on every week.
